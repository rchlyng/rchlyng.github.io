    </header>

    <p>Hi, I'm Rachel and this website was made for my Activist Website Project. My idea was advocating for free meals for all students enrolled in public school. I was motivated to do my website on this topic because lunch was free for the 2021-2022 school year due to Covid. This was the first time where lunch lines were long and students were motivated to eat. However, I am sure with the removal of free lunch this year, my peers will not get school food anymore. </p>

    <p>Meals For Students is bringing awareness to the need for free lunch for all. In California alone, about 60% of students in publiuc school qualify for free/reduced lunch. Communities of color, communities of immigrants, and communities of students that rely on meals provided from school may be denied, are not aware to sign-up to be provided with lunch, or are embarrassed of their financial situation. Regardless of which scenario, all students enrolled in public school should be fed during school hours for free.</p>

    <h3>✩Encourage those around you to fill out forms to recieve free/reduced lunch. Regardless if they need it or not.</h3>
    <h3>✩Push your school district to fund school meals by contacting adminsitration and the district board.</h3>
    <h3>✩Actually eat school food. If schools see students eating the lunch, there is more of an incentive to make it free.</h3>
